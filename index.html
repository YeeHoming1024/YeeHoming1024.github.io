<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I received the B.S. degree from the Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, in 2020, and the M.S. degree from Jiangnan University, in 2023. I am currently a graduate student in the Intelligent Detection and System Security Lab(IDSSL), School of Internet of Things Engineering, Jiangnan University. My main research interests include Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Battery Prognostics. Also, I do some research about Industrial Data Analysis and Time Series Prediction. I focus on using AI algorithm to solve practical industry problems, such as remaining useful life prediction of Lithium-ion batteries.</p>
